# Fairy-Stockfish-X

## Purpose

Fairy-Stockfish-X is an experimental branch of the Fairy-Stockfish project with the following goals:

1. To test and combine various feature suggestions that are not yet ready for the main Fairy-Stockfish codebase.
2. To provide a platform for iterating on these experimental features.
3. To serve as a permanent home for chess variants that are considered too unconventional for the mainline code.

For standard Fairy-Stockfish functionality and supported variants, please refer to the [main Fairy-Stockfish repository](https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish).
